                          between 80-90% are normally achieved giving primary fuel savings of approximately 
                          35% compared to separate generation. This directly reduces the users fuel

                          for generating electricity and heat. For instance, instead of producing 
                          electricity, the shaft power can be used to drive compressors for air-conditioning 
                          chiller and industrial refrigeration plant or to supply compressed air. 
                          The recovered heat, instead of being used for water heating, can be used 
                          either for cooling purposes via absorption chillier, or for heating air 
                          to space-or dryer heating.</td>

                          &deg;C. Temperature below this figure may cause condensation to take place 
                          which result in corrosion. Further heat can be recovered with condensing 
                          heat exchangers; these are often use for meeting low temperature loads,

                          correct sizing of the cogeneration system involves identifying the potential 
                          for energy conservation and assessing likely changes in the sites future 
                          energy demand. The response to any remaining uncertainty in the level of 
                          demand should be to undersize units and ensure high utilization levels. 
                          Units should normally be sized at around 50% of the sites maximum thermal 
                          demand, with the additional heat demand being met by conventional boilers. 
                          It may be appropriate to incorporate an element of thermal storage into

                          are several configurations for connecting the cogeneration system to the 
                          existing heating and electrical systems. Most systems are connected in series 
                          with existing heating systems, although parallel connection may be selected 
                          for new installations, particularly when cogeneration supplies a large proportion 
                          of the heat load. Electrical connection is normally to the low voltage system, 
                          although units rated more than 500 eke and with high load factor may be 
                          linked directly to the high voltage system and export power back to the 
                          grid during periods of low demand. Most cogeneration systems use synchronous 
                          generations. There, although connected to the public electricity supply, 
                          operate independently of the grid and can therefore continue to supply power 
                          in the event of grid failure.</td>
